# LiveChatApp


With the goal of learning Flask and Socket.io, I created a Python Live Chat application. This project showcases a web-based chat application built with Flask and Socket.io. Its primary focus is on enabling seamless real-time communication between users. The application allows users to create new chat rooms or join existing ones using unique room codes, facilitating instant and secure conversations. Its architecture leverages Flask, a Python web framework, for server-side operations, while Socket.io handles WebSocket-based communication for real-time messaging.
